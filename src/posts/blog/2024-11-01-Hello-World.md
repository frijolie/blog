Hello everybody! Welcome to {{ site.title }} website. This is the first post on this website. I thought it would be a good idea to introduce myself and what the goals are for this site.

I am an avid comic book nerd. Over the years of collecting and acquiring comic books, I have amassed a sizeable collection of comics. This includes single issues, trade paperbacks, hardcovers, epic collections, deluxe editions, and omnibusses. Has anybody ever figured out the proper plural form of 'omnibus?' Is it omnibi? omnibusses? omniboo? I digress.

One may think that I have always been diligent in reading them as fast as they have been aquired. Well, I'm sure you can guess, this has never been the case. Therefore, I'd like to start whittling away at my to-read pile. However, because of the sizable stack of books to read, I also figure that I may want to occasionally reflect upon what I've read. Therefore, the plan is, I will be writing up a brief review of the books when I complete them.

The current plan is to focus on independent books rather than the "big two" (Marvel and DC). More than likely, I will be reading books from publishers that are one of the big names of the comic book industry. This could also include Dark Horse, Image, IDW, Boom, Dynamite, etc. Although, I will reserve the right to throw in any book that catches my eye. Maybe I'll be intrigued by a book by a larger publisher or may even need a break from an indie book.

So, with that being said, this is my intention&mdash;to chronicle the journey through my to-read pile of books all they way till the end. I hope you'll enjoy my reviews and will come back to visit. Perhaps we'll share an opinion on a book or I will convince you to read a book on your own and share you thoughts.
