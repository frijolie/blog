title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Brian. I am a middle-aged guy that occasionally has some free time. With that free time, I mostly elect to do some nerdy things. Does creating a website and writing reviews of comics count as nerdy? Yeah, I'll bet everybody would say that counts. Oh well, so I'm a nerd. Doesn't bother me.

If you're actually reading this, perhaps you may actually be interested if ever so slightly. So I kinda feel obligated to tell you a bit about myself.

Besides being a comic book nerd, I'm also a computer nerd. _record scratch_ Oh no!

I am an IT professional by day and a keyboard warrior by night. I have a degree in Computer Information Systems from the university. To summarize what I do for a living, I'd classify myself, in broad terms, as an Enterprise Software Systems Administrator&trade;. What does that mean for the layman? I am just a monkey that clicks buttons. Well, that's not _actually_ my job title. However, that's part of the fun, you'll have to guess what it is if you _really_ care about it.

Some more stuff about me: I am married, have three children, and live in the glorious state of Utah. Alright, I already know what you're thinking. To answer those questions that immediately came to your mind: Yes and Yes I do.

Now to let you in on some of my hobbies. As previously stated, I enjoy to read. More specifically, I enjoy to read comic books. Don't get me wrong, I do like a good prose novel. However, I must fall back to where I have made my largest investment. I have been ~~collecting~~ acquiring comic books, off and on, for more than three decades. Because of this, I have acquired a rather large stack of books over the years. Have I read all of my books? Nah, I can't really say that I have. Not gonna lie. Do you really expect me to have read them all?

I am also a die-hard ice hockey fan. It so happens that I am a fan of the New Jersey Devils. Two of my kids play or have played little league hockey. So hockey is kinda in our families blood. Recently Salt Lake City has acquired an ice hockey team of their own. Therefore, since it's sorta my hometown team, I've taken a liking to them as well. Currently, they're known as the "Utah Hockey Club." Yes, I know, an odd name. But, it's temporary so don't fret. It'll change here probably next season to something more lasting.

I do like myself some hair metal and/or glam metal music. Ok, I think I just dated myself and not in the romantic kinda way. Guess I should have said _aged_ myself. My other kid, the non-hockey playing kid, is an amazing musician. He plays the guitar and has began producing his own music&mdash;the infamous SoundCloud rappers. I jest.

I don't know what else you'd want to know; favorite color? food group?
