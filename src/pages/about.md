Hello! My name is Brian. I am a middle-aged guy that occasionally has some free time. With that free time, I, more often than not, elect to do some nerdy things. I'll bet you'd say that developing this website just to write a review on a comic book that I just read would count as nerdy. Oh well, what am I gonna do? I'm a nerd. Doesn't bother me.

If you're actually reading this, you must be really bored or have an inkling of interested. Therefore, I kinda feel obligated to oblige ever so slightly.

On a serious note, I am an IT professional by day and a keyboard warrior by night. I graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Information Systems. The IT industry is pretty broad. So, if I wanted to stick myself in a box, I'd claim to be an Enterprise Software Administrator&trade;. What does that mean for the layman? I am just a cog in a wheel that develops, deploys, and maintains things that do other things to fulfill a request.

More about myself: I am married and have three teenage children. Our family lives in the glorious state of Utah in a suburb of *the* major city. Alright, if you're not from here, I already know what you're thinking. I'll just settle those questions in your head: Yes and Yes I do.

Perhaps, as you just learned, I enjoy reading books and, more specifically, comics. I have been ~~collecting~~ acquiring comic books, off and on, for more than three decades. That is no hyperbole, that's the honest truth. Because of this, as you can imagine, I have acquired a sizable stack of books over the years. This has caused some strain on the storage space around the house. With the amount of books I've acquired, I can't say that I've read them all. That would be insanity. There was a period of time I was purchasings them faster than I was able to read 'em. So I figured that writing a review of the books as I read them would be a neat little side project. Except, I didn't have a place to host these reviews. So, what you're reading right now, is the side project of the side project. I have ~~plans~~ hopes to review the books I find useful or interesting. I couldn't write about them all nor would I want to. That would turn out to be more of a job than a hobby.

Besides comics I am a die hard fan of ice hockey. Been watching and participating in the fandom of hockey since the early 90s. Did I just age myself? Over this time, I have became a fan of the New Jersey Devils. That's a long story that isn't important, so I'll skip it here. In addition to watching it on television, two of my kids play the sport. So between trips to the rink and watching our team on television, you could say that hockey is kinda in our blood. Recently Utah has acquired an [<abbr title="National Hockty League">NHL</abbr>](https://nhl.com) team of their own. So, in addition to the Devils, I'm obligated to also follow the "Utah Hockey Club." Yes, I know, an odd name. But, it's temporary so don't fret. It'll change before the next season. My money is on "Yeti's" what do you think?

Well, I think this is enough about me. If you have other questions or want to provide some feedback on the site, you can drop me a line on the [Contact](/pages/contact/) page.
